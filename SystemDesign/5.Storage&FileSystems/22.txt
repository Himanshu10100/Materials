Excellent topic.
This is **foundational system-design knowledge**, and many engineers misuse storage because they never internalize this difference.

I’ll explain **Block vs File storage**, then contrast them with **Object/Blob storage** so the mental model is complete.

# Block Storage vs File Storage (End-to-End)

---

## 1️⃣ Start with the simplest mental model

Think in **levels of abstraction**:

```
Block storage  →  lowest level
File storage   →  built on blocks
Object storage →  completely different model
```

If this hierarchy is clear, everything else becomes easy.

---

## 2️⃣ Block Storage

### What is Block Storage?

> **Block storage gives you raw chunks of storage that behave like a physical disk.**

You don’t get files.
You get **blocks**.

Example services:

* Amazon EBS
* Google Persistent Disk

---

### How block storage works

```
Application
 ↓
File System (EXT4, XFS, NTFS)
 ↓
Block Storage (virtual disk)
```

* You format it
* You mount it
* You manage files yourself

---

### Characteristics of Block Storage

| Aspect            | Block Storage    |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Access            | Mounted disk     |
| Granularity       | Block-level      |
| Latency           | 🔥 Very low      |
| Random read/write | ✅ Excellent      |
| Sharing           | ❌ Single machine |
| Scaling           | Manual           |
| Ops effort        | High             |

---

### Typical use cases

✔ Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
✔ Transaction logs
✔ OS disks
✔ VM disks

**Why DBs love block storage:**

* Precise control
* Fast random I/O
* Journaling support

---

### Why block storage is NOT for file sharing

* One VM at a time (usually)
* No built-in file locking across machines
* Scaling is painful

---

## 3️⃣ File Storage

### What is File Storage?

> **File storage provides a shared file system accessible by multiple machines.**

You work with:

* Files
* Folders
* Paths

Example services:

* Amazon EFS
* Google Filestore

---

### How file storage works

```
Multiple Servers
      ↓
 Shared File System (NFS)
```

* OS-level file access
* POSIX semantics
* Network-based

---

### Characteristics of File Storage

| Aspect       | File Storage        |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Access       | Network mount       |
| Sharing      | ✅ Multiple machines |
| File locking | ✅                   |
| Latency      | Medium              |
| Performance  | Lower than block    |
| Scaling      | Easier than block   |
| Cost         | Higher              |

---

### Typical use cases

✔ Shared uploads
✔ CMS content
✔ User home directories
✔ Legacy apps needing shared FS

---

### Why file storage is NOT for high-performance DBs

* Network latency
* Lock contention
* Lower IOPS

DB + file storage = pain.

## 4️⃣ Block vs File — Direct Comparison

| Aspect              | Block Storage  | File Storage  |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Level               | Low-level disk | High-level FS |
| Managed FS          | ❌              | ✅             |
| Multi-server access | ❌              | ✅             |
| Latency             | Very low       | Medium        |
| DB workloads        | ✅ Best         | ❌             |
| Shared files        | ❌              | ✅             |
| Ops complexity      | High           | Medium        |

---

## 5️⃣ Where Object / Blob Storage fits (important)

This clears confusion.

| Storage Type  | What it stores  | Access   |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| Block         | Disk blocks     | OS mount |
| File          | Files & folders | OS mount |
| Object / Blob | Binary objects  | HTTP     |

**Object storage is NOT built on block/file semantics.**

That’s why:

* No partial writes
* No file locking
* Infinite scale
* Cheap

---

## 6️⃣ Your backend / POS context (very important)

### Correct choices

| Need              | Storage       |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| MySQL DB          | Block storage |
| App logs (local)  | Block         |
| Shared temp files | File (rare)   |
| Images            | Object/Blob   |
| Invoices PDFs     | Object/Blob   |
| Reports export    | Object/Blob   |

---

### ❌ Common wrong designs

❌ Storing images on EBS
❌ Using EFS for invoices
❌ Sharing DB data directory over file storage

These fail at scale.

---

## 7️⃣ Interview-grade explanation (say this)

> Block storage provides raw disk volumes with low latency and high IOPS, making it ideal for databases and operating systems. File storage adds a shared file system layer on top, allowing multiple machines to access files concurrently. Object storage is different altogether, exposing data as immutable objects over HTTP and is preferred for storing media and unstructured data.

That’s a **strong, clear, senior-level answer**.

---

## 8️⃣ Brutal truth (important)

If you don’t consciously choose:

* block for DB
* file for shared FS
* object for media

Your system will:

* cost more
* scale poorly
* break under load

---

## One-line rule to remember forever

> **Databases want blocks, apps want objects, legacy systems want files.**
