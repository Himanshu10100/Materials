# Object Storage (S3, GCS) — End to End

Examples:

* Amazon S3
* Google Cloud Storage

---

## What is Object Storage (in one line)

> **Object storage stores files as immutable objects accessed via HTTP, not as files on a disk.**

This single sentence already separates beginners from system designers.

---

## Why object storage exists (real problem)

Imagine storing these in DB or server disk:

* Product images
* Invoice PDFs
* Videos
* Logs
* Backups

Problems:

* Server disk fills up
* No horizontal scaling
* Backup nightmare
* Slow serving to users
* High infra cost

Object storage **solves all of this**.

---

## How Object Storage Works (mentally)

```
Bucket
 ├── object_1 (image.jpg)
 ├── object_2 (invoice.pdf)
 ├── object_3 (video.mp4)
```

Each object has:

* **Key** (unique name)
* **Data** (file bytes)
* **Metadata** (content-type, size, permissions)

No folders.
Folders are just **key prefixes**.

---

## Key difference vs File System

| Aspect    | File System    | Object Storage   |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Hierarchy | Real folders   | Flat (key-based) |
| Access    | OS mount       | HTTP API         |
| Update    | Partial writes | Full replace     |
| Scaling   | Hard           | Infinite         |
| Cost      | High           | Cheap            |
| Speed     | Fast locally   | Network-based    |

---

## Why objects are immutable (important)

You **cannot modify part of a file**.

If you “edit”:

```
invoice.pdf
```

What actually happens:

* New object uploaded
* Old object replaced (or versioned)

This is intentional:
✔ Simpler consistency
✔ Easy replication
✔ Easy CDN caching

---

## Typical architecture (what you should design)

```
Client
  ↓ (upload)
Backend (auth, validation)
  ↓
Object Storage (S3/GCS)
  ↓
CDN (Cloudflare)
  ↓
User downloads
```

Backend **never serves files directly**.

---

## Example: POS Invoice PDF flow

1. User generates invoice
2. Backend creates PDF
3. Uploads to S3
4. Saves S3 URL in DB
5. Frontend accesses via CDN

Why?

* Backend stays stateless
* Files served cheaply
* Infinite scale

---

## Upload patterns (important)

### ❌ Bad

```
Client → Backend → Disk → Client
```

### ✅ Good

```
Client → Backend (signed URL)
Client → S3 directly
```

---

## Pre-signed URLs (must-know)

Backend generates:

* Temporary upload/download URL
* Limited time
* Limited permission

Example use:

* Secure uploads
* Private invoice downloads

This avoids routing GBs of data through your API.

---

## Security model (important)

Object storage uses:

* Buckets (containers)
* IAM / ACLs
* Public vs private objects

Rules:

* **Public** → images, assets
* **Private** → invoices, reports

Never expose bucket credentials to frontend.

---

## Durability & reliability (why S3 is trusted)

S3 durability:

> **99.999999999% (11 nines)**

This means:

* Your file is safer than your DB disk
* Replicated across zones automatically

This is why:

* Backups
* Logs
* ML datasets
* Media

→ always go to object storage.

---

## Cost model (why it’s cheap)

You pay for:

* Storage size
* Requests
* Bandwidth out

You **don’t** pay for:

* Servers
* Scaling
* Replication logic

Compare that to running file servers yourself → pointless.

---

## How CDN fits perfectly with object storage

Object storage:

* Slow-ish per request
* Optimized for durability

CDN:

* Fast delivery
* Edge caching

Together:

> **Infinite storage + fast global delivery**

---

## Common mistakes (watch yourself)

❌ Storing images in DB
❌ Serving files from backend
❌ Using local disk in containers
❌ Treating S3 like a file system
❌ Renaming objects instead of versioning

---

## How this helps in AI era (important insight)

AI systems rely heavily on:

* Datasets
* Model artifacts
* Logs
* Embeddings
* Audio/video

All of this lives in:

> **Object storage**

If you don’t understand S3/GCS, you **cannot design AI systems**.

---

## Interview-ready explanation

> Object storage like S3 or GCS stores data as immutable objects accessed via HTTP. It provides massive scalability, high durability, and low cost, making it ideal for storing media, backups, logs, and large datasets. In system design, object storage is typically combined with CDN for efficient global delivery while keeping application servers stateless.

That’s a **solid senior-level answer**.

---

## Brutal truth (for you)

If you ever think:

> “I’ll just store files on the server”

You are:

* fighting the cloud
* designing non-scalable systems
* creating future outages
