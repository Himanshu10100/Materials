Got it, Himanshu 👍
Thanks for sharing openly — you already have a solid foundation (MERN + MySQL + POS project experience + internship + now working as SDE-1). The next 2–5 years can shape your career very well if you’re structured. Let’s break this down into **roadmap + skills + habits + leadership**.

---

## 🎯 2-Year Roadmap (SDE-1 ➝ SDE-II at Big Tech)

You have 2 hours/day → \~15 hrs/week → \~700 hrs/year. That’s enough if used well.

---

### 1. **Core CS & Problem Solving (50%)**

Big Tech interviews = **DSA + System Design**.

* **DSA:**

  * Finish **Graphs & DP** thoroughly (LeetCode medium/hard).
  * Then move to **advanced topics** → Tries, Segment Trees, Bitmasking, Union-Find, Heaps.
  * Daily practice → 2–3 problems (LeetCode, Codeforces).
  * Track patterns (sliding window, binary search on answer, monotonic stack, etc.).

* **System Design:**

  * Start with **Low-level design (LLD):** OOP, design patterns, SOLID, UML diagrams.
  * Then move to **High-level design (HLD):** caching, load balancing, databases, queues, sharding, CAP theorem.
  * Build small system design notes with diagrams (e.g., "Design URL Shortener", "Design Instagram").
  * Resources: *Grokking the System Design Interview*, *System Design Primer (GitHub)*.

---

### 2. **Backend & Advanced Tech (25%)**

Big tech expects **scalable systems knowledge**:

* **Databases:** Advanced SQL, indexing, query optimization, transactions.
* **Scalable Backend:** Learn Redis, Kafka/RabbitMQ, microservices basics.
* **Cloud:** AWS/GCP basics (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, IAM).
* **DevOps:** You already know Docker & CI/CD → add Kubernetes (k8s).
* **Testing:** Unit + integration testing (Jest, Mocha, PyTest).

---

### 3. **Communication & Leadership (15%)**

Your weakness = **English + patience** → this will directly affect interviews & leadership.

* Daily **30 mins English practice** (watch tech talks, summarize in English, write LinkedIn posts).
* Do **mock interviews** (Pramp, friends, peers).
* Start mentoring juniors in your current company → builds leadership.
* Practice explaining code/system as if teaching → builds patience + clarity.

---

### 4. **Projects & Visibility (10%)**

* Convert your POS/ecommerce work into **scalable open-source projects**.
* Build 1–2 **system design showcase projects** (e.g., chat app with WebSockets + Redis, or scalable notification service).
* Share learnings on GitHub & LinkedIn → recruiters notice consistency.

---

## 🏆 5-Year Goal (SDE-III + Leadership)

By year 5, you should target **Staff Engineer or Tech Lead track**.
That requires:

1. **Deep technical expertise** (scalable backend + architecture).
2. **Strong communication & leadership** (mentorship, code reviews, guiding team).
3. **Cross-functional ability** (working with Product, QA, DevOps).

So in years 3–5:

* Lead small modules/projects at work.
* Mentor 1–2 juniors consistently.
* Improve decision-making (trade-offs, performance vs. cost).
* Public presence → blogs, talks, open-source.

---

## 📅 Daily/Weekly Study Plan (2 hrs/day)

**Daily:**

* 1 hr → DSA/Problem-solving.
* 30 min → System Design/CS fundamentals.
* 30 min → Communication (English, explaining concepts, mock interview).

**Weekly:**

* 3–4 hrs weekend → Advanced backend/Cloud/DevOps projects.

---

## 🚀 Extra Habits

* **Patience:** Practice debugging without rushing. Take breaks during stuck problems.
* **Focus:** Use Pomodoro (25–5 rule).
* **Networking:** Connect with engineers on LinkedIn, attend meetups.
* **Interview prep timeline:** Start mock interviews \~6 months before applying.

---

✅ Summary for you, Himanshu:

1. Next 2 years → **DSA + System Design + Advanced Backend + Communication.**
2. Build **realistic scalable projects** & publish them.
3. Improve English daily, and mentor others for leadership.
4. By 5 years → aim for **Tech Lead** level.

Would you like me to make a **month-by-month roadmap (next 6 months)** so you can start tracking progress step by step?
