# ðŸ“š **System Design Topics (Step by Step)**

### 1. **Foundations**

* Scalability basics (vertical vs horizontal scaling)
* Latency vs throughput
* CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance)
* ACID vs BASE

---

### 2. **Networking & Communication**

* DNS, IP, Load balancer basics
* HTTP/HTTPS, REST vs gRPC
* WebSockets, Long polling, SSE (Server-Sent Events)
* CDN (Content Delivery Network)

---

### 3. **Databases**

* SQL vs NoSQL
* Indexing, Partitioning, Sharding
* Replication (Master-slave, Multi-leader)
* Transactions (ACID), Isolation levels
* Caching in DB (query optimization)

---

### 4. **Caching**

* Client-side vs Server-side caching
* CDN cache
* Redis / Memcached
* Cache eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO)
* Cache consistency & invalidation

---

### 5. **Storage & File Systems**

* Object storage (S3, GCS)
* Blob storage
* Distributed File Systems (HDFS, Ceph)
* Block storage vs File storage

---

### 6. **Message Queues & Streaming**

* Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
* Pub/Sub systems
* Event-driven architecture
* Stream processing (Apache Kafka Streams, Flink, Spark Streaming)

---

### 7. **System Components**

* Load Balancers (L4 vs L7)
* Reverse proxy (NGINX, HAProxy)
* API Gateway
* Rate limiting, Throttling
* Service discovery

---

### 8. **Microservices & Architecture**

* Monolith vs Microservices
* Service-to-service communication
* Circuit breaker pattern
* Saga pattern (for distributed transactions)
* Sidecar pattern (Service mesh: Istio/Envoy)

---

### 9. **Search & Indexing**

* Search engines (Elasticsearch, Solr)
* Inverted index
* Full-text search
* Autocomplete systems

---

### 10. **Scalability & Availability**

* Horizontal scaling (stateless services)
* Replication strategies
* Data consistency (strong vs eventual)
* Leader election (Raft, Paxos basics)

---

### 11. **Observability & Reliability**

* Logging (ELK stack)
* Metrics (Prometheus, Grafana)
* Monitoring, Alerting
* Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
* SLAs, SLOs, SLIs

---

### 12. **Security**

* Authentication (OAuth, JWT, SSO)
* Authorization (RBAC, ABAC)
* HTTPS, TLS, Certificates
* Hashing & Encryption (bcrypt, AES)
* API rate limiting for security

---

### 13. **Design Patterns in System Design**

* Singleton, Factory, Observer (basic OOP patterns)
* CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
* Event Sourcing
* Sharding pattern
* Retry & Backoff

---

### 14. **Case Studies (End-to-End Designs)**

* URL Shortener (Bit.ly)
* Tiny Google Drive (File Storage system)
* WhatsApp / Messenger (Chat app)
* Instagram / Twitter feed system
* Netflix / YouTube (Video streaming)
* Uber / Ola (Ride sharing system)
* Amazon Shopping Cart & Order system

---

ðŸ‘‰ If you go through **1 â†’ 14 in order**, youâ€™ll build a rock-solid system design base.

---

Do you want me to create a **6-month plan** where I assign which topics to cover each month (with practice projects)? That way youâ€™ll not just read but also *apply* system design step by step.
