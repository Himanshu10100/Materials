Great 👍 Let’s dive into **Callbacks** in JavaScript.

---

## 🔹 What is a Callback?

A **callback** is simply a **function passed as an argument to another function**, which will be **called later** once some task is done.

👉 In short:

> A callback is "call me back later when you’re done".

---

## 🔹 Example 1 – Basic Callback

```js
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
  callback();
}

function afterGreeting() {
  console.log("Nice to meet you!");
}

greet("Himanshu", afterGreeting);
```

✅ Output:

```
Hello, Himanshu
Nice to meet you!
```

* `afterGreeting` is passed as a callback to `greet`.
* `greet` calls it after finishing its own work.

## 🔹 Example 2 – Callbacks with Asynchronous Code

Callbacks are very common with **async operations** like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, or database queries.

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

✅ Output:

```
Start
End
This runs after 2 seconds
```

Here, the arrow function is a **callback** that runs **after 2s**.

---

## 🔹 Example 3 – Custom Async Callback

```js
function fetchData(callback) {
  console.log("Fetching data...");
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Here is your data!");
  }, 1500);
}

fetchData((data) => {
  console.log("Received:", data);
});
```

✅ Output:

```
Fetching data...
Received: Here is your data!
```

---

## 🔹 Example 4 – Callback Hell (The Problem)

When you have many async operations **dependent on each other**, callbacks can get **nested** and messy:

```js
getUser(1, (user) => {
  getPosts(user.id, (posts) => {
    getComments(posts[0].id, (comments) => {
      console.log("First comment:", comments[0]);
    });
  });
});
```

😵 This is called **“Callback Hell”** → hard to read and maintain.

---

## 🔹 Why Callbacks Are Important

1. Handle async operations (timers, API requests, file reading).
2. Pass logic into reusable functions.
3. Foundation for **Promises** and **async/await** (modern solutions).

---

✅ In interviews, a callback is often defined as:
**“A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is executed after the completion of that function’s operation.”**
