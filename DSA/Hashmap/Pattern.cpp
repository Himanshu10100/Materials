## âœ… **Checklist: HashMap / HashSet Mastery**

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Basics of Hashing**

* [x] What is a hash function?
* [x] What is hashing used for?
* [x] Difference between `unordered_map`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_set`

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Frequency Count / Presence Check**

* [x] Count frequency of numbers or characters
* [x] First non-repeating character
* [x] Check for duplicates in array

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Pattern-Based Applications**

* [x] Two Sum problem using map
* [x] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
* [x] Count distinct elements in window (used with sliding window + set/map)
* [x] Group Anagrams using hashmap with sorted string as key

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Advanced Hash Map Problems**

* [x] Subarrays with sum K (Prefix sum + HashMap)
* [x] Detect cycle in a sequence (used in fast-slow pointers or hash set)
* [x] Isomorphic strings / Anagram checks
