Yes, based on your current level and what’s generally asked in interviews or coding rounds — **your understanding of HashMap and Set will be considered complete if you cover the following areas:**

## ✅ **Checklist: HashMap / HashSet Mastery**

### 🔹 1. **Basics of Hashing**

* [x] What is a hash function?
* [x] What is hashing used for?
* [x] Difference between `unordered_map`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_set`

### 🔹 2. **Frequency Count / Presence Check**

* [x] Count frequency of numbers or characters
* [x] First non-repeating character
* [x] Check for duplicates in array

### 🔹 3. **Pattern-Based Applications**

* [x] Two Sum problem using map
* [x] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
* [x] Count distinct elements in window (used with sliding window + set/map)
* [x] Group Anagrams using hashmap with sorted string as key

### 🔹 4. **Advanced Hash Map Problems**

* [x] Subarrays with sum K (Prefix sum + HashMap)
* [x] Detect cycle in a sequence (used in fast-slow pointers or hash set)
* [x] Isomorphic strings / Anagram checks

### ✅ **What is a hash function?**

A **hash function** is a function that takes input (often a key like a string, number, etc.) and **converts it into a fixed-size integer** (called the *hash code* or *hash value*).

> 🔑 **Key Idea**: Same input always gives the same hash value.

#### 📦 Example:

```cpp
int hashValue = hash<string>{}("Alice");
```

This uses C++'s built-in hash function for strings and converts `"Alice"` into an integer.

### ✅ **What is hashing used for?**

**Hashing** is used to **map data to a fixed-size table** for **fast access**.

### 🛠 Applications:

* Implementing **hash tables** (like `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`)
* Checking **data integrity** (e.g., file hashes)
* Cryptography (e.g., SHA-256)
* Load balancing, caches (e.g., consistent hashing)

### 🕒 Hashing is ideal when you need:

* **Constant-time lookups** → O(1) average
* **Efficient insertions/deletions**

### ✅ **Difference Between Containers**

| Feature                   | `unordered_map`          | `map`                         | `set`                | `unordered_set` |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| **Key-Value?**            | Yes                      | Yes                           | No (only keys)       | No (only keys)  |
| **Ordering**              | No (unordered)           | Yes (sorted by key)           | Yes (sorted)         | No              |
| **Underlying Structure**  | Hash Table               | Red-Black Tree (Balanced BST) | Red-Black Tree (BST) | Hash Table      |
| **Average Time (Search)** | O(1)                     | O(log n)                      | O(log n)             | O(1)            |
| **Worst-Case Time**       | O(n) (due to collisions) | O(log n)                      | O(log n)             | O(n)            |
| **Duplicates?**           | No                       | No                            | No                   | No              |

### 🔄 Quick Summary:

| Container       | Ordered? | Fast Access? | Stores Values As     |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| `unordered_map` | ❌        | ✅ O(1)       | `key -> value` pairs |
| `map`           | ✅        | ❌ O(log n)   | `key -> value` pairs |
| `set`           | ✅        | ❌ O(log n)   | `keys only`          |
| `unordered_set` | ❌        | ✅ O(1)       | `keys only`          |

### 🎯 When to Use What?

* Use `unordered_map` when **you need fast access and don’t care about order**.
* Use `map` when **you need sorted data** (e.g., for range queries).
* Use `set` when you want to **store unique items in sorted order**.
* Use `unordered_set` when you want **unique items and fast lookup**.
