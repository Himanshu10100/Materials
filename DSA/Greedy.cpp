Absolutely! Let’s start from **zero** and work step-by-step.

## 🧠 **What is a Greedy Algorithm?**

A **Greedy Algorithm** is an approach for solving problems where you:

> **Make the best choice at each step**, hoping that these local choices will lead to a **globally optimal solution**.

---

### 🔑 **Key Idea**:

Choose **what looks best right now** — don't worry about the future.
Greedy algorithms don't always work for every problem, but when they do, they are **very fast and simple**.

---

## ✅ When to Use Greedy Algorithms

* When **local optimization** leads to **global optimization**.
* When the problem has:

  * **Greedy choice property**
  * **Optimal substructure**

> Don't worry — we'll explain these with examples.

---

## 📘 Let's Begin With Simple Example

---

### 📍 **Example 1: Coin Change (Greedy Version)**

> You have coins of denominations `{1, 2, 5, 10}`
> You want to make amount = `18` using **minimum number of coins**.

### 💡 Greedy Strategy:

* Always pick the **largest coin** that is **less than or equal** to the remaining amount.

### ✅ Code in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void greedyCoinChange(int amount, vector<int> coins) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = coins.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        while (amount >= coins[i]) {
            amount -= coins[i];
            result.push_back(coins[i]);
        }
    }

    cout << "Coins used: ";
    for (int coin : result)
        cout << coin << " ";
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> coins = {1, 2, 5, 10};
    int amount = 18;
    greedyCoinChange(amount, coins);
    return 0;
}
```

### 🧾 Output:

```
Coins used: 10 5 2 1
```

> Works well because coin denominations allow greedy choice to be optimal.

---

## ⚠️ When Greedy Fails

### Example: Coin denominations {1, 3, 4}, Amount = 6

* Greedy picks: 4 → 1 → 1 → total 3 coins
* Optimal: 3 + 3 → total 2 coins
  ✅ So: **Greedy doesn’t always give optimal solution**

---

## 🧭 Classic Greedy Problems

Let’s level up and explore some famous greedy problems:

---

### 📌 **1. Activity Selection Problem**

> Given `n` activities with start and end times.
> Select the **maximum number of activities** that don't overlap.

#### 💡 Greedy Strategy:

* Always pick the activity that **finishes earliest**.

#### ✅ C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Activity {
    int start, end;
};

bool compare(Activity a, Activity b) {
    return a.end < b.end; // Sort by end time
}

int maxActivities(vector<Activity>& activities) {
    sort(activities.begin(), activities.end(), compare);

    int count = 1;
    int lastEnd = activities[0].end;

    for (int i = 1; i < activities.size(); i++) {
        if (activities[i].start >= lastEnd) {
            count++;
            lastEnd = activities[i].end;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<Activity> activities = {{1, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 5}, {0, 6}, {5, 7}};
    cout << "Max activities: " << maxActivities(activities) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 📌 **2. Fractional Knapsack**

> You have items with `weight` and `value`. You can **take fractions** of items.
> Maximize value within `W` weight.

#### 💡 Greedy Strategy:

* Pick item with highest `value/weight` ratio first.

#### ✅ C++ Code (simplified):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Item {
    int weight, value;
};

bool compare(Item a, Item b) {
    double r1 = (double)a.value / a.weight;
    double r2 = (double)b.value / b.weight;
    return r1 > r2;
}

double fractionalKnapsack(int W, vector<Item>& items) {
    sort(items.begin(), items.end(), compare);

    double totalValue = 0.0;
    for (Item item : items) {
        
        if (W >= item.weight) {
            W -= item.weight;
            totalValue += item.value;
        } else {
            totalValue += item.value * ((double)W / item.weight);
            break;
        }
    }
    return totalValue;
}

int main() {
    vector<Item> items = {{10, 60}, {20, 100}, {30, 120}};
    int capacity = 50;
    cout << "Max value: " << fractionalKnapsack(capacity, items) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## ✅ Greedy Algorithm Pattern

1. **Sort or order the input** based on some logic.
2. **Make the best local choice** (according to a condition).
3. **Repeat** until done.
