graph have nodes & edges

node: entity for store data
edges : lines that connect nodes
degree: nomber of edges connected to node
path: 
=>a-b-c ✔
=>a-b-c-a ❌(same node not come twice)

*****Undirected graph : 
=> a<->b or a-b : a->b & b->a
=> degree

*****directed graph : 
=> a->b : a->b not b->a
=>Indegree(toward to node) , outdegree(from node)

*****weighted graph:
=> in graph edges have weight(value)
=> if weight not that assuem 1
=> weighted directed graph
=>weighted Undirected graph

*****cyclic graph:
=> a->b->c->d->a then it is cyclic grapgh
=>weighted cyclic directed graph

*****Asyclic graph:
=>dont have cycle between nodes

*****REPRESENTATION:::
1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List
